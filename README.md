# LEMPDash
LEMPDash is a collection of bash tools to aid the creation of nginx sites. Includes nginx server block and mysql database creation, backup, destruction, etc.

##System Requirements
LEMPDash is written and tested on Ubuntu 14.04 only, all other buyers, beware! Unless you have alot of free time.

###Recommended/Required Packages:
* nginx
* mysql-server
* php5-fpm
* php5-mysql

###Assumptions (for now)
* Nginx is here: /etc/nginx
* You are cool with your server root(s) being here: /var/www/YOURSITE(S)/htdocs

## Installation
Get it:

```
git clone git@github.com:pbredenberg/lempdash.git
```

Install it:
```
cd lempdash
```
```
sudo ./install
```

## Usage
Lempdash is invoked thusly:
```
ldash
```

LEMPDash must be run as sudo when executing processes on the system level, for instance, when creating or removing nginx server blocks.

As of this version (0.0.01), you can only create or remove nginx server blocks.

### cr (Create)
Create a thing:
```
ldash cr site mysite.com
```

### rm (Remove)
Remove a thing:
```
ldash rm site mysite.com
```

Note: Remove wants to do it's thing safely, so it will back up your site files automatically using zip, and place the backup in var/www/archive/YOURSITENAME.
